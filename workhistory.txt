details.js slideshow resizing stuff
date	site	version

[230]	2014/05/21	rtbahamas	28		I may have finally found a solution for letting the slideshow be squishy while resizing while also keeping the matchmedia orientation listener that is necessary for some mobile devices.
		+waitForFinalEvent needs to be added to global.js along with this commit

[210]	2014/05/07	callenders	207		Isolated reusable styles for slideshows that have thumbnail navigation.

[150]	2014/02/01	mobilebrl	1062		added matchmedia and sjs.manualupdate stuff - The slideshow now properly changes height when changing device orientation (tested on iphone safari, android chrome & firefox).
[140]	2014/01/31	mobilebrl	1056		important comments - Some progress on getting slideshow to size properly when switching orientation. I think it works on chrome android but doesn't get triggered at all on iOS safari. Disabled for now.
[130]	2014/01/30	mobilebrl	1034		activate navigation option
[120]	2014/01/29	mobilebrl	1031		Copied code from Callenders... probably removed some stuff that was callenders specific
[110]	2013/11/29	callenders	104		Put a a setTimeout delay on the resize event code so resizing windows or rotating devices is not sluggish.
[100]	2013/10/15	callenders	74 		when it was added to callenders
