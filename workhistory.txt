I don't know what happened but it seems I can now get away with doing the slideshow enhancements (centering images in slides) after dom:ready instead of waiting for full window.load event. I tested safari, firefox, and chrome with 2meg and 5 meg fullsized images in slides on Explore Albany page and they got centered....


ehhh.. not quite. 
on some page loads I get lucky, other times I don't.

I should look into having the images within each slide also self center as they self load like I am doing with the thumbnails on the details page

tracking down relevant commits in various realtycore projects to build a sensible history of work
on the slidesjs based slideshow resizing and thumbnail nav enhancements

details.js slideshow resizing stuff
date	site	version

[80]	2014/05/21	rtbahamas	28		I may have finally found a solution for letting the slideshow be squishy while resizing while also keeping the matchmedia orientation listener that is necessary for some mobile devices.
		+waitForFinalEvent needs to be added to global.js along with this commit
		
[70]	2014/05/07	callenders	207		Isolated reusable styles for slideshows that have thumbnail navigation.
		Add caption as title on thumbnails (done via js)
		Make all slideshows fade by default.
[60]	2014/03/31	callenders	146		Moved centerImage js to global.js
[50]	2014/02/01	mobilebrl	1062		added matchmedia and sjs.manualupdate stuff - The slideshow now properly changes height when changing device orientation (tested on iphone safari, android chrome & firefox).
[40]	2014/01/31	mobilebrl	1056		important comments - Some progress on getting slideshow to size properly when switching orientation. I think it works on chrome android but doesn't get triggered at all on iOS safari. Disabled for now.
[30]	2014/01/30	mobilebrl	1034		activate navigation option
[20]	2013/11/29	callenders	104		Put a a setTimeout delay on the resize event code so resizing windows or rotating devices is not sluggish.
[10]	2013/10/15	callenders	74 		when it was added to callenders


//----------------------------- 

Now selectively merging contents of [10] - [80] into merged.js to see what I end up with.
